## About
This project expands on the previous blog site by adding a database which allows blog posts to persist after a page refresh. MongoDB was chosen as the database for its ease of representing blog posts as JSON and its package manager, mongoose, which allows for ease of database setup. It features a custom RESTful API to handle the user blog post request to the database and serving the stored data back to the webpage to be viewed.

### Features

* Blog posts can be viewed anytime now that data is stored in a database 
* Can create, read, update, and delete blog posts
* Previous blog site features remain
